# ðŸš€ React Counter App (Functional Components)
Getting some hands-on experience about React Hooks, State and Props Management, using functional components

1. Firstly let's clean up the current `App.tsx` file content our project.
2. Let's define `App.tsx` fie's structure as a React functional component like this.
 ```typescript jsx
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
    return (
        <div className="app">
            <h1>This is App Component!</h1>
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
